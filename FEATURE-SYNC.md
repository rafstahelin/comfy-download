# Security Enhancements for Upcoming Update

## Security Recommendations

- [ ] Replace hardcoded paths with environment variables
  - Create a configuration file for customizing paths
  - Add environment variable validation
  - Remove hardcoded references to `/workspace/`

- [ ] Add proper input validation for all script arguments
  - Validate all parameters passed to scripts
  - Use explicit parameter patterns and reject unexpected inputs
  - Implement safe defaults for missing parameters

- [ ] Improve file handling with proper quoting
  - Audit all scripts for proper quoting of variables
  - Use array-based command construction for complex commands
  - Implement safe pattern matching for file operations

- [ ] Implement process safety mechanisms
  - Add mutex locking to prevent race conditions
  - Use PID files to ensure single instance execution
  - Add safety checks before destructive operations

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
  - Use `set -e` and `set -o pipefail` for safer execution
  - Implement proper exit codes
  - Add failure recovery mechanisms

- [ ] Implement secure logging practices
  - Add log rotation
  - Sanitize sensitive data in logs
  - Set appropriate file permissions for log files

- [ ] Use secure methods for temporary files
  - Use `mktemp` with proper flags
  - Add cleanup handlers with trap
  - Implement proper exit traps

- [ ] Improve cron job management
  - Make cron job installation more transparent
  - Allow configurable schedules
  - Provide options to review cron jobs before installation

## Development Plan

1. Create a dedicated security-enhancement branch
2. Implement changes incrementally with proper testing
3. Document all security improvements in CHANGELOG.md
4. Review security updates before merging to main branch
