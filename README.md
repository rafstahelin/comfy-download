# ComfyUI Download and Sync Manager

## Overview
The ComfyUI Download Manager is a system for automatically monitoring and processing images generated by ComfyUI. It provides a simple command-line interface for managing the download and organization of your AI-generated images, along with automatic backup and bidirectional synchronization of your ComfyUI user settings with Dropbox.

> **Note:** This repository is independent from the [easy](https://github.com/rafstahelin/easy) repository. Each repository should be installed separately.

## Installation

### Standalone Installation
```bash
cd /workspace/comfy-download
chmod +x setup.sh
bash setup.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Installation with Easy [DEPRECATED]
**Note:** As of the latest version, comfy-download should be installed directly, not through the Easy setup. The following installation method is deprecated and no longer supported:

```bash
# DEPRECATED - Do not use this method
cd /workspace/easy
chmod +x setup.sh
bash setup.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

Instead, install each repository separately to avoid alias conflicts.

## Usage
After installation, the following commands are available:

### Core Commands
```
dl start                   - Start all automated services
  --workflows              - Only start workflow sync services
  --nodes                  - Only start custom node sync services
  --comfy                  - Only start ComfyUI settings sync services
dl stop                    - Stop all automated services
dl status                  - Show current system status

```

## How It Works

### Image Downloads
- When you run `dl start`, a cron job is set up to run every minute
- The cron job executes the download script which checks for new images in `/workspace/ComfyUI/output/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Processed images are logged in `/workspace/ComfyUI/logs/downloaded_YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- Statistics can be viewed at any time using the `dl status` command

### User Settings Backup
- When you run `dl start`, an immediate backup of your ComfyUI user settings is performed
- A cron job is set up to back up your settings every 30 minutes
- The backup includes the entire `/workspace/ComfyUI/user/default/` folder
- Files are compressed as a timestamped zip file and uploaded to Dropbox at `dbx:/studio/ai/libs/comfy-data/default-bckp`
- Backup status can be viewed with the `dl status` command
- Manual backups can be triggered with the `dl backup` command

### Synchronization Types
The system handles three types of synchronization:

#### 1. Workflow Synchronization
- Syncs the `/workspace/ComfyUI/user/default/workflows/` directory
- Runs every 5 minutes when started
- Can be manually triggered with `dl sync --workflows`
- Ensures your workflow files are kept in sync between different environments

#### 2. ComfyUI Settings Synchronization
- Syncs the ComfyUI settings and templates files:
  - `/workspace/ComfyUI/user/default/comfy.templates.json`
  - `/workspace/ComfyUI/user/default/comfy.settings.json`
- Runs every 10 minutes when started
- Can be manually triggered with `dl sync --comfy`
- Keeps your ComfyUI configuration consistent across environments

#### 3. Custom Node Data Synchronization
- Syncs custom node data directories:
  - `/workspace/comfy-data/milehighstyler` ↔ `dbx:/studio/ai/libs/comfy-data/milehighstyler`
  - `/workspace/comfy-data/plushparameters` ↔ `dbx:/studio/ai/libs/comfy-data/plushparameters`
  - `/workspace/comfy-data/plushprompts` ↔ `dbx:/studio/ai/libs/comfy-data/plushprompts`
- Runs every 30 minutes when started
- Can be manually triggered with `dl sync --nodes`
- Ensures consistent custom node configurations across environments

### All-in-One Synchronization
- You can sync everything in a single operation with `dl sync`
- This is useful when you want to ensure all data is synchronized at once
- The `dl start` command by default runs all sync operations

### Custom Node Configuration Management
- When you run `dl start`, custom node configurations are automatically validated and fixed
- A cron job is set up to check configurations every 6 hours
- The checker manages:
  - Plush-for-ComfyUI configuration (`/workspace/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/Plush-for-ComfyUI/user/text_file_dirs.json`)
  - ComfyUI-Easy-Use styles symlink (`/workspace/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Easy-Use/styles`)
- Manual configuration check can be triggered with the `dl checkconfig` command

## Directory Structure

- `/workspace/comfy-download/` - Scripts and configuration
- `/workspace/ComfyUI/output/YYYY-MM-DD/` - Generated images organized by date
- `/workspace/ComfyUI/logs/` - Download, backup, and sync logs
- `/workspace/ComfyUI/user/default/` - User settings synchronized with Dropbox
  - `/workspace/ComfyUI/user/default/workflows/` - Workflows synchronized with Dropbox
  - `/workspace/ComfyUI/user/default/comfy.templates.json` - Templates synchronized with Dropbox
  - `/workspace/ComfyUI/user/default/comfy.settings.json` - Settings synchronized with Dropbox
- `/workspace/comfy-data/` - Custom node data synchronized with Dropbox
  - `/workspace/comfy-data/milehighstyler/` - MileHighStyler data for ComfyUI-Easy-Use
  - `/workspace/comfy-data/plushparameters/` - Parameter files for Plush-for-ComfyUI
  - `/workspace/comfy-data/plushprompts/` - Prompt files for Plush-for-ComfyUI
- `/tmp/comfyui-backup/` - Temporary location for zip files during backup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"Command not found" when running dl commands**
  - Ensure you've sourced your bashrc: `source ~/.bashrc`
  - Check if the alias is correctly defined: `grep "alias dl=" ~/.bashrc`
  - Verify script path: `ls -la /workspace/comfy-download/dl-manager.sh`

- **No images being processed**
  - Check if ComfyUI is generating images to the expected directory
  - Verify directory permissions: `ls -la /workspace/ComfyUI/output/`
  - Run manually once to debug: `dl run`

- **Backup or sync not working**
  - Verify rclone is properly configured: `rclone config`
  - Check if source directory exists: `ls -la /workspace/ComfyUI/user/default`
  - Check backup log: `cat /workspace/ComfyUI/logs/backup.log`
  - Check sync log: `cat /workspace/ComfyUI/logs/bisync.log`
  - Try running backup or sync manually: `dl backup` or `dl sync`

- **Bidirectional sync conflicts**
  - If you encounter conflicts, run a forced sync with: `dl sync`
  - Check the bisync log for details: `cat /workspace/ComfyUI/logs/bisync.log`
  - If necessary, you can ensure fresh sync by deleting the sync state: `rm -f /workspace/ComfyUI/user/default/.rclone-bisync*`

- **Custom node sync issues**
  - Check if custom node data directories exist: `ls -la /workspace/comfy-data/`
  - Check custom sync log: `cat /workspace/ComfyUI/logs/custom_sync.log`
  - Try running custom sync manually: `dl sync --nodes`

- **Custom node configuration issues**
  - Check if custom nodes are installed: `ls -la /workspace/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`
  - Check configuration log: `cat /workspace/ComfyUI/logs/node_config.log`
  - Run configuration check manually: `dl checkconfig`

- **Cron job not running**
  - Check cron service status: `service cron status`
  - View current cron jobs: `crontab -l`
  - Check system logs: `grep CRON /var/log/syslog`

- **Alias conflicts with other repositories**
  - If you're experiencing alias conflicts, run: `/workspace/comfy-download/fix-aliases.sh`
  - Then reload your shell configuration: `source ~/.bashrc`

### Advanced Debugging

For more detailed debugging:

- Check script execution directly:
  ```bash
  bash -x /workspace/comfy-download/dl-manager.sh help
  bash -x /workspace/comfy-download/backup_comfyui.sh force
  bash -x /workspace/comfy-download/bisync_comfyui.sh force
  bash -x /workspace/comfy-download/custom_sync.sh force
  bash -x /workspace/comfy-download/node_config_checker.sh apply
  ```

- Verify file permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x /workspace/comfy-download/*.sh
  ```

- Monitor sync operations in real-time:
  ```bash
  tail -f /workspace/ComfyUI/logs/bisync.log
  tail -f /workspace/ComfyUI/logs/custom_sync.log
  ```

- Test rclone connectivity:
  ```bash
  rclone lsd dbx:
  ```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Workflow Size
For best performance with the bidirectional sync:
- Keep your workflow directory size under 30MB if possible (20-30MB is ideal)
- Consider moving rarely used or archived workflows to a separate location outside the synced directory
- The sync process might take longer with larger workflow directories
- A staged approach to transition from 100MB to 30MB might be:
  1. First, identify and move archived/rarely used workflows to a non-synced archive folder
  2. Organize remaining workflows into logical subfolders
  3. Consider compressing complex workflows where possible
