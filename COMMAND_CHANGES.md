# Command System Changes

## Overview

The ComfyUI Download Manager command system has been reorganized to provide a clearer, more intuitive interface. This document outlines the changes and provides migration guidance for existing users.

## New Command Structure

Commands are now organized into logical groups:

### Core Commands

```
dl start                   - Start all automated services
  --workflows              - Only start workflow sync services
  --nodes                  - Only start custom node sync services
dl stop                    - Stop all automated services
dl status                  - Show current system status
dl help                    - Display this help message
```

### Manual Operations

```
dl run                     - Process new images once
dl backup                  - Run backup manually once
dl sync                    - Run complete sync manually
  --workflows              - Sync only workflows
  --nodes                  - Sync only custom nodes
dl checkconfig (cc)        - Check and fix node configurations
```

### Utilities

```
dl report                  - Generate comprehensive system report
dl reset                   - Clean up duplicate log entries
```

## Deprecated Commands

The following commands are deprecated and will be removed in a future update:

```
dl bisync, dl bi           → use 'dl sync --workflows' instead
dl customsync, dl cs       → use 'dl sync --nodes' instead
```

During the transition period, these commands will continue to work but will display deprecation warnings.

## What's Changed?

1. **Simplified Command Naming**: 
   - Removed redundant aliases
   - Used consistent naming patterns
   - Improved command discoverability

2. **Better Option Handling**:
   - All flags now use `--option` format
   - Options are listed under their parent commands in help

3. **Improved Output**:
   - Commands now provide more feedback about what's happening
   - Deprecated commands show helpful migration messages

4. **Organized Help Output**:
   - Commands are grouped by function
   - Better formatting for readability

## Testing the Changes

The changes are available in the `feature/command-cleanup` branch for testing. To test:

```bash
cd /workspace/comfy-download
git fetch
git checkout feature/command-cleanup

# Try the new commands
./dl-manager.sh help
./dl-manager.sh sync --workflows
```

Compare with the original behavior before reporting any issues.

## Implementation Details

1. The main `dl-manager.sh` script has been refactored for better option handling
2. All core functionality remains the same

4. Help output is reorganized for clarity

## Feedback

After testing, please provide feedback on:
1. Any bugs or issues encountered
2. Command usability improvements
3. Additional commands that might be helpful
4. Suggestions for further simplification
